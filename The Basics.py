# Ok. So you know this:

#abc = input("Please enter your favourite letter --> ")

# In prints and inputs you can also make it so you can use unlimited lines
# by doing this:

#print("""Hi there
#My name is Ryan.
#Nice to meet""")

# You can also do what I done above with input.
# By putting int(input()) instead of input() you can make it so people can only
# enter number into that input. However this will cause an error if something
# is entered that is not a number.

#intinputeg = int(input("Hi please enter a number"))

# As you should be able to see I entered "abc" which is a string not a number.
# This lead to an error. But when I enter a number the error doesn't happen.
# There is a way to get round this but I'll get into that later.

# Any questions up to now?
# Ok. Have you learned anything about if/elif/else statements; also known as
# functions?

# Ok, do you want me to do a breif explain or just carry on to something else?
# Right, have you heard of a for function/in range function (i've kinda for got
# what its called :/.

# Example:
for i 












# Ingore this:
def clear():
    for i in range(200):
        print()
